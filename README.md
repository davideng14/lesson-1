# Integrate React Router to our application 

As part of our class, this is the repository with the example how React Router can be added to the project and how to create routes and componentes for each one of these.

Remember the steps:

- Add the library to the project with `npm install react-router-dom@6`, @6 is optional, this is just to specify the version, if not, will be installed the last version.
- Go to `src/index.js` file and add `BrowserRouter` component to wrap the `App` component.
- Create the routes and the components to show in each one of this.

for further information, please go to [React Router Instalation](https://reactrouter.com/en/v6.3.0/getting-started/installation)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
